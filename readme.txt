This project was submitted for the final assignment of my upper division data science course at Santa Clara University. We were given the freedom of choosing our project, and I took advantage of a public data set that contained wavelet transformed imaging data of authentic and counterfeit bills. I produced a model that has a high accuracy for correctly classifying these banknotes.
