This project was submitted for the final assignment of my upper division data science course (CSCI 183) at Santa Clara University. We were given the freedom of choosing our project, and I took advantage of a public data set that contained wavelet transformed imaging data of authentic and counterfeit bills. I explored and compared how different algorithms like SVM performed in classifying instances (banknotes) correctly.
